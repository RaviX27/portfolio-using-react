      </h2>
      <p className='about-content'>I am Umanda Wanninayake, a passionate and motivated third-year Information and Communication Technology student at the Faculty of Technology in the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. With a current GPA of 3.40, I am eager to embark on a Software Engineering Internship where I can apply my technical proficiency, problem-solving skills, and collaborative teamwork in a dynamic learning environment.
        In my academic journey, I have honed my skills in various programming languages including Java, Python, and JavaScript. My coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in essential areas such as Object-Oriented Programming, Machine Learning, Web Development, Data Structure and Algorithm, and Database Systems. I bring to the table a keen understanding of Quality Assurance, having gained practical experience as a Quality Assurance Technician at Global System Solutions International. During my tenure, I not only sharpened my teamwork skills through collaborative projects but also contributed to the collective success of the team by fostering effective communication.
        Outside the realm of technology, I have further enriched my communication skills through a Diploma in English from the British Way English Academy. This has empowered me to express ideas clearly and collaborate effectively in diverse settings.
        I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills and enthusiasm to a challenging internship role, where I can continue to grow as a software engineer and make meaningful contributions to innovative projects.
